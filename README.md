Hello!

Thank you for taking the time to review this codebase, I really appreciate it! This is my proposed implementation for case study #1, Billing Engine.

There are a few considerations and restrictions I've put in the design - I did not add a full-blown error handling, database structure, mocks, complex decimal handling and/or unit test setup, mostly because of the time restriction and the expected scale of this project, but the code is designed to be fairly simple, maintanable, scalable and readable. And you should be able to run the code (one would hope) using the provided dummy data. Please reach out if you need more context. Any feedback is appreciated and I look forward to hear back from you :blush:
